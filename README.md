# Visual-Linux
Description: to be added fully in detail later; primarily to make CL interfaces less intimidating to users and make them more self explanatory and *humane*. Perhaps a GUI, TUI, or even a verbose CLI that doesn’t feel like a military general barking orders at you. 

The current issue: CLIs are *extremely* intimdiating and an absolute black box of terrible (feature) discovery, completely violating severl "good human design" principles.

This project aims to add a visual layer *on top of* the CLI, to turn it into a still-powerful, but now approachable, and crucially, *easy to use* (via button presses or simply knowing what options to turn on on which function) tool! Let there me no more angry generals barking at you, but rather a friendly, humane hand that doesn't require you to be a wizard to even start with!
